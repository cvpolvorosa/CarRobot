# CarRobot
   This sketch is intended for the e-Gizmo MOBOT, accompanied by an Android phone application.
   The smartphone acts as the remote controller for the mobile robot, which communicates
   through bluetooth. It can command the robot to go forward, left, right, reverse, go on auto-pilot,
   or line follower mode. While on auto-pilot, the robot uses its front infrared sensors for collision avoidance.
   While on line follower mode, the robot uses its infrared line tracking sensors to follow a black path.

   Requirements: e-Gizmo MOBOT, HC-06 bluetooth module, Android smartphone
